%SHORTDESCRIPTION%

%TOC%

---++ Usage

This extensions applies a "hotfix" for Foswikitask:Item12849 to your Foswiki 1.1.0 thru 1.1.9 system.   This patch has not been tested against Foswiki 1.0.x.

<blockquote>
<div class="foswikiAlert">%X% *NOTICE:* This patch adds a new ACL feature to Foswiki. Foswiki 1.2 will finish the deprecation of the empty DENYTOPICVIEW=
ACL, replacing it with a new wildcard ACL:  =Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = *=   Without this patch, extensions developed using the new ACL syntax will not be backwards
compatible with Foswiki 1.1.x. </div>
</blockquote>

With this patch applied, the mechanism of using an empty =DENYTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= rule can be replaced with the equivalent 
=ALLOWTOPIC&lt;action&gt; = *=.   A utility is also provided that will convert any existing empty DENYTOPIC rules into the equivelant ALLOWTOPIC rule.
Note that empty =DENYWEB= ACLs are treated as comments, and are not active.

This patch does not remove the empty =DENYTOPIC= behavior.

While the empty =DENY= is only functional for =DENYTOPIC=, the =ALLOW *= is active at either the =TOPIC= or =WEB= level.

For example, if you want completely open access to a topic, then use the following rule:
   * <tt>Set ALLOWTOPICVIEW = *</tt>: This allows view access by anyone including the anonymous !WikiGuest user. 

| | *Without this patch* | *With patch applied* | *Notes* |
| Allow ALL users to a topic | Set =DENYTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= to an empty string | =Set ALLOWTOPIC&lt;action&gt;= to * | Empty =DENYTOPIC= is still usable until Foswiki 1.2 |
| Allow ALL users to a web | Do not set any ALLOW or DENY ACLs | _(no change)_ %BR%-or-%BR%Set ALLOWWEB&lt;action&gt; = * | Adding the ALLOW = * may better document intention vs. oversight |
| Allow All logged-in users%BR%to a topic or web | Set =DENY= to %USERSWEB%.WikiGuest | Leave =ALLOW= un-set,%BR%-or-%BR% Set =ALLOW= to * | The addition of ALLOW is unnecessary, but may better document the intentions. |
| Deny all access | Set ALLOW to NobodyGroup | Set ALLOW to NobodyGroup%BR%-or-%BR% Set DENY to * |
| Allow selected users | Set ALLOW to desired users/groups | _(no change)_ |
| Deny selected users | Set DENY to desired users/groups | _(no change)_ |
 
<blockquote class="foswikiHelp"> %X% Note that it is not possible to override a DENY with an ALLOW at the same level    ALLOW on a topic can override DENY at the web level, but not at the TOPIC level</blockquote>

</blockquote>

This extension ships with the following patch files:

| *Original Issue* | *Patch File* | *Description* | *Applies to* |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12849][Item12849]] | =Item12849-001= | Add ALLOW / DENY wildcard syntax | Foswiki 1.1.0 |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12849][Item12849]] | =Item12849-002= | Add ALLOW / DENY wildcard syntax | Foswiki 1.1.1 - Foswiki 1.1.3 |
| [[http://foswiki.org/Tasks/Item12849][Item12849]] | =Item12849-003= | Add ALLOW / DENY wildcard syntax | Foswiki 1.1.4 |

Before any file is patched, a backup is copied to =working/configure/backup/&lt;Item12849-001-date-time&gt;=. Each file that is a candidate to be patched is backed up.  If the extensions is installed multple times, a new backup is made for each run, regardless of whether or not the patch will be applied.  For this patch, the following files are copied:
   * =lib/Foswiki/Users.pm=

Patches are only applied if the target file is an _exact_ match to the original file.  There is no attempt to do "fuzzy" patching. 

If your system uses alternate locations for web names and directories, patches will be mapped from the default Foswiki filename to the directory location used on the target system.

If this contrib is uninstalled, the patches will be reversed and the original files restored.
